# HotelSystem 2018
A hotel booking system written in C#, which utilises databases to store booking and hotel information.  
Directory contains the final report for the project, which outlines the project life cycle that was followed to achieve the deliverable.  

As this is my earliest project, some of the coding methods used may be a bit questionable, such as not clearly commenting code and labelling files effectively.  
However, I learned a lot from this project, to develop a better grasp of project management and professional standards of code, which is demonstrated in my later projects.
